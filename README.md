# The Last Treat!
This is the Megathon'24 project by Machine AI'nt Learning team, based on OSDG problem.

We have Conceptualized a Game of 1 Ghost Player and multiple Characters (Players) trying to survive:
- Characters : Has to collect all the TRICK or TREAT candies
- Ghost : Has to kill all players

### The Characters have a limited area of vision, making the game spooky. The vision increases as players collect more and more Candy, Once they collect all the candies they win.

### The Ghost has a long range of vision, it cannot pick up any Candy. It needs to kill all players to win.
