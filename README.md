# The Last Treat!
This is the Megathon'24 project by Machine AI'nt Learning team, based on OSDG problem.

We have Conceptualized a Game of 1 Ghost Player and multiple Charecter Players trying to survive:
- Charecters : Has to collect all the TRICK or TREAT candies
- Ghost : Has to kill all players

### The Charecter has limited area of vision, making the game spooky. The vision increases as players collect more and more Candy, Once they collect all the candies they win.

### The Ghost has a long range of vision, it cannot pick up any Candy. It needs to kill all players to win.

We have used few open sources free to use online resourses, or resourses with MIT lisence. Mostly Art was made internally, using Krita, Paint, Bandlabs, etc.
40-50% Code was written with Github Copilot Enabled to assist Debugging and Templating.
